Overview
This project aims to predict the scores of Indian Premier League (IPL) matches using machine learning algorithms. The Indian Premier League is one of the most popular Twenty20 cricket leagues worldwide, and predicting scores accurately can provide valuable insights for teams, broadcasters, and fans.

Data
The dataset used for this project contains historical IPL match data, including information about teams, venues, innings, runs scored, wickets taken, and various other features that could influence the outcome of a match.

Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Feature Engineering: Derived additional features such as run rate, required run rate, and player performance metrics.
Model Selection: Experimented with various machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, random forest, gradient boosting, and neural networks to find the best-performing model.
Model Training and Evaluation: Trained the selected model on a training dataset and evaluated its performance using cross-validation techniques and appropriate evaluation metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized the model's hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or random search to improve its performance.
Deployment: Deployed the trained model using a web-based interface or API for users to make real-time score predictions.
Results
The trained model achieved [insert performance metrics here], indicating its effectiveness in predicting IPL match scores. However, further improvements could be made by incorporating additional features or experimenting with advanced modeling techniques.

Usage
To use the IPL score prediction model:

Install the required dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
Run the predict_score.py script with appropriate input parameters (e.g., team, venue, innings, etc.).
The script will output the predicted score for the given match.
Future Work
Explore ensemble learning techniques to combine predictions from multiple models.
Incorporate real-time data feeds during matches to adjust predictions dynamically.
Extend the prediction model to include player-level performance predictions and match outcome probabilities.
